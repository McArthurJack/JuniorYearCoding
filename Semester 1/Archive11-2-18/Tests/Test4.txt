It does 0 times 10 + 1.
does that ten times and increments J 10 times.
Then it repeats the same but i becomes 1.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... Goes to 100

It takes the value of i and increments j by it. It goes from 1 to 2 to 3. Then goes from 2 to 4 to 6. Then goes from 3 to 6 to 9.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7...
2,4,6,8...
3,6,9...
